# Game score

Fullstack web application (clean frontend backend split) to log sports game results.

User can

- enter a game score (date, home team, away team, final score)
- view all game score (winning team highlight in green, losing team in red)

The idea and app features is bare-bones by design. This is a hobby project using older boring robust battle-tested technologies. And simulating small dev team environment.

## Tech stack

Frontend

- javascript/typescript + popular frontend library (react, vue, angular...)
- depending on interest, css and component libraries

Backend

- java
- mysql
